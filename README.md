What is StackStrap?
===================
After some time we have come to realize that the ideas behind StackStrap
should not be tied to any particular community. It is also clear that
the project has been difficult to explain.

Is it a tool? Is it a collection of highly usable Salt States? Is it a Vagrant
plugin? It will likely become all of those things. Ultimately StackStrap
is an attempt to construct a PaaS by combining three tools in the most common
sense way possible. The goal is to ensure that the process remains entirely
suggestive so that users can pick and choose how to use the offerings.
The guidlines outlined in [twelve-factor app is a methodology][twelve-factor]
will always be kept in mind, but will never trump rational argument.

## What is next?

This tool will soon be undergoing a [rebuild]. The idea is to worry less about
Templates and more about the services which run your application.
