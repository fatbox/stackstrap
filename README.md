What is StackStrap?
===================

Is it a tool? Is it a collection of highly usable Salt States? Is it a Vagrant
plugin? It will likely become all of those things. Ultimately StackStrap
is an attempt to construct a PaaS by combining three tools in the most common
sense way possible. The goal is to ensure that the process remains entirely
suggestive so that users can pick and choose how to use the offerings.
The guidlines outlined in [twelve-factor app is a methodology][twelve-factor]
will always be kept in mind, but will never trump rational argument.

## What is next?

This tool will soon be undergoing a [rebuild]. Improvements will be made to how
Templates are dealt with and the tool will start to offer options for easily
managing the services that run your application.
