What is StackStrap?
===================
After some time we have come to realize that the ideas behind StackStrap
should not be tied to any particular community. It is also clear that
the project has been difficult to explain.

Is it a tool? Is it a Vagrant extension? Is it a collection of highly usable
Salt States? It will likely become all of those things. Ultimately StackStrap
is an attempt to construct a PaaS by combining three tools in the most common
sense way possible. The goal is to ensure that the process remains entirely
suggestive so that users can pick and choose how to use the offerings.
The guidlines outlined in [twelve-factor app is a methodology][twelve-factor]
will always be kept in mind, but will never trump rational argument.

A new project is being kicked off to better handle Templating file and folder
scaffolds. Templates will still be offered that focus on StackStrap methods,
but the overall project is focused on Templating a project with any tools.
